# NexusBot

Version 1.1


# Setup

This system runs great on Heroku. Had to jump through some hoops to do so, but it was a good learning experience.

We use a `web` process to receive webhooks from external services and run a `worker` process for each bot.

## Discord Bot

Responds to the following commands
   
   `!GovHelp`
   
   `!Proposals`
   
   `!Cycle`
